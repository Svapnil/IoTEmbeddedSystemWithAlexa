# IoTEmbeddedSystemWithAlexa
This is an extension of the work I did on my ECE306 class, where I connected my IoT vehicle to the Amazon Alexa. The network gist is that Alexa calls an AWS Lamda function, which called an ngrok link which is forwarded to a computer on the same server as the IoT car, where the command is then relayed to the local IP that the car is on.
